#+TITLE: MRS test suite in GR

- MRS test suite :: available at
                    [[http://moin.delph-in.net/MatrixMrsTestSuite]]

this is an attempt at parsing the MRS test suite in GF, creating a new
test treebank. work has started for English and Portuguese concretes,
but new languages are welcome!

this treebank will be used as a test to improve the Portuguese
resource grammar.

note that some sentences had no parse, and some had more than one. an
attempt is being made to select the better parse tree, but it is not
complete yet.

* reproduce
1. install GF [[http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index.html][here]] (if you prefer, there are docker images [[https://github.com/odanoburu/docker-gf][here]]).
2. build grammar PGF:
   : gf --make --optimize-pgf Matrix*.gf

** generate treebank with linearizations
this will only linearize the manually selected trees.
: gf --run < mk-treebank.gfs > treebank.txt
